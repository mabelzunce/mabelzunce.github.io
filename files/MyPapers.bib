abstract = {Tomographic Gamma Scanners are tools for nondestructive assay and characterization of nuclear waste drums. In these scanners, a three dimensional image of the activity distribution of every radioisotope stored in the drum is obtained by performing a single-photon emission tomography. AR-TGS is a novel architecture of tomographic gamma scanners that combines an HPGe detector with six NaI(Tl) detectors in order to achieve high-sensitivity. In this work, a projector for a 2D MLEM reconstruction algorithm of AR-TGS is presented. This projector models the geometry of the system, the collimator's response and the attenuation in the field of view by performing a ray-tracing with several lines of response per detector. The projector was evaluated with Monte Carlo simulations of different phantoms and with experimental measurements. The algorithm proved to be an accurate model of the acquisition process and was used to reconstruct data sets with different strategies, such as utilising matched and unmatched projector/backprojector pairs. The results showed that the use of this projector in image reconstruction considerably improved spatial resolution and image quality compared with an attenuated Siddon projector. The quantification properties of the algorithm for homogeneous and heterogeneous drums matrices were also analyzed. {\textcopyright} 1963-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Objective: To design, develop and evaluate an automated multi-atlas method for segmentation and volume quantification of gluteus maximus from Dixon and T1-weighted images. Materials and methods: The multi-atlas segmentation method uses an atlas library constructed from 15 Dixon MRI scans of healthy subjects. A non-rigid registration between each atlas and the target, followed by majority voting label fusion, is used in the segmentation. We propose a region of interest (ROI) to standardize the measurement of muscle bulk. The method was evaluated using the dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and the relative volume difference (RVD) as metrics, for Dixon and T1-weighted target images. Results: The mean(± SD) DSC was 0.94 ± 0.01 for Dixon images, while 0.93 ± 0.02 for T1-weighted. The RVD between the automated and manual segmentation had a mean(± SD) value of 1.5 ± 4.3{\%} for Dixon and 1.5 ± 4.8{\%} for T1-weighted images. In the muscle bulk ROI, the DSC was 0.95 ± 0.01 and the RVD was 0.6 ± 3.8{\%}. Conclusion: The method allows an accurate fully automated segmentation of gluteus maximus for Dixon and T1-weighted images and provides a relatively accurate volume measurement in shorter times ({\~{}} 20 min) than the current gold-standard manual segmentations (2 h). Visual inspection of the segmentation would be required when higher accuracy is needed.},

abstract = {Purpose: To propose a framework for synergistic reconstruction of PET-MR and multi-contrast MR data to improve the image quality obtained from noisy PET data and from undersampled MR data. Theory and Methods: Weighted quadratic priors were devised to preserve common boundaries between PET-MR images while reducing noise, PET Gibbs ringing, and MR undersampling artifacts. These priors are iteratively reweighted using normalized multi-modal Gaussian similarity kernels. Synergistic PET-MR reconstructions were built on the PET maximum a posteriori expectation maximization algorithm and the MR regularized sensitivity encoding method. The proposed approach was compared to conventional methods, total variation, and prior-image weighted quadratic regularization methods. Comparisons were performed on a simulated [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose-PET and T1/T2-weighted MR brain phantom, 2 in vivo T1/T2-weighted MR brain datasets, and an in vivo [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose-PET and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery/T1-weighted MR brain dataset. Results: Simulations showed that synergistic reconstructions achieve the lowest quantification errors for all image modalities compared to conventional, total variation, and weighted quadratic methods. Whereas total variation regularization preserved modality-unique features, this method failed to recover PET details and was not able to reduce MR artifacts compared to our proposed method. For in vivo MR data, our method maintained similar image quality for 3× and 14× accelerated data. Reconstruction of the PET-MR dataset also demonstrated improved performance of our method compared to the conventional independent methods in terms of reduced Gibbs and undersampling artifacts. Conclusion: The proposed methodology offers a robust multi-modal synergistic image reconstruction framework that can be readily built on existing established algorithms.},

abstract = {Although the use of iterative algorithms for image reconstruction in 3D Positron Emission Tomography (PET) has shown to produce images with better quality than analytical methods, they are computationally expensive. New Graphic Processor Units (GPUs) provide high performance at low cost and programming tools that make it possible to execute parallel algorithms in scientific applications. In this work, a GPU parallel implementation of the iterative reconstruction algorithm MLEM 3D has been developed using CUDA, a parallel model from NVIDIA. The Siddon algorithm was used as Projector and Backprojector. Acceleration factors up to 85 times were achieved, with respect to a single thread CPU implementation. The performance in GPU with Tesla and Fermi, which are respectively the first and the last generation of CUDA compatible architectures, has been compared. The image quality in each platform has been analyzed, showing a higher level of noise in GPU, due to race condition problems. The new features of Fermi architecture permitted to solve this problem using atomic operations. {\textcopyright} Belzunce et al.},

abstract = {Positron emission tomography (PET) suffers from poor spatial resolution which results in quantitative bias when evaluating the radiotracer uptake in small anatomical regions, such as the striatum in the brain which is of importance in this paper of neurodegenerative diseases. These partial volume effects need to be compensated for by employing partial volume correction (PVC) methods in order to achieve quantitatively accurate images. Two important PVC methods applied during the reconstruction are resolution modeling, which suffers from Gibbs artifacts, and penalized likelihood using anatomical priors. The introduction of clinical simultaneous PET-MR scanners has attracted new attention for the latter methods and brought new opportunities to use MRI information to assist PET image reconstruction in order to improve image quality. In this context, MR images are usually down-sampled to the PET resolution before being used in MR-guided PET reconstruction. However, the reconstruction of PET images using the MRI voxel size could achieve a better utilization of the high resolution anatomical information and improve the PVC obtained with these methods. In this paper, we evaluate the importance of the use of MRI voxel sizes when reconstructing PET images with MR-guided maximum a posteriori (MAP) methods, specifically the modified Bowsher method. We also propose a method to avoid the artifacts that arise when PET reconstructions are performed in a higher resolution matrix than the standard for a given scanner. The MR-guided MAP reconstructions were implemented with a modified Lange prior that included anatomical information with the Bowsher method. The methods were evaluated with and without resolution modeling for simulated and real brain data. We show that the use of the MRI voxel sizes when reconstructing PET images with MR-guided MAP enhances PVC by improving the contrast and reducing the bias in six different regions of the brain using regional metrics for a single simulated data set and ensemble metrics for ten noise realizations. Similar results were obtained for real data, where a good enhancement of the contrast was achieved. The combination of MR-guided MAP reconstruction with point-spread function modeling and MRI voxel sizes proved to be an attractive method to achieve considerable enhancement of PVC, while reducing and controlling the noise level and Gibbs artifacts.},

abstract = {Component-based normalization is a method used to compensate for the sensitivity of each of the lines of response acquired in positron emission tomography. This method consists of modelling the sensitivity of each line of response as a product of multiple factors, which can be classified as time-invariant, time-variant and acquisition-dependent components. Typical time-variant factors are the intrinsic crystal efficiencies, which are needed to be updated by a regular normalization scan. Failure to do so would in principle generate artifacts in the reconstructed images due to the use of out of date time-variant factors. For this reason, an assessment of the variability and the impact of the crystal efficiencies in the reconstructed images is important to determine the frequency needed for the normalization scans, as well as to estimate the error obtained when an inappropriate normalization is used. Furthermore, if the fluctuations of these components are low enough, they could be neglected and nearly artifact-free reconstructions become achievable without performing a regular normalization scan. In this work, we analyse the impact of the time-variant factors in the component-based normalization used in the Biograph mMR scanner, but the work is applicable to other PET scanners. These factors are the intrinsic crystal efficiencies and the axial factors. For the latter, we propose a new method to obtain fixed axial factors that was validated with simulated data. Regarding the crystal efficiencies, we assessed their fluctuations during a period of 230 d and we found that they had good stability and low dispersion. We studied the impact of not including the intrinsic crystal efficiencies in the normalization when reconstructing simulated and real data. Based on this assessment and using the fixed axial factors, we propose the use of a time-invariant normalization that is able to achieve comparable results to the standard, daily updated, normalization factors used in this scanner. Moreover, to extend the analysis to other scanners, we generated distributions of crystal efficiencies with greater fluctuations than those found in the Biograph mMR scanner and evaluated their impact in simulations with a wide variety of noise levels. An important finding of this work is that a regular normalization scan is not needed in scanners with photodetectors with relatively low dispersion in their efficiencies.},

abstract = {Purpose: Numerous image reconstruction methodologies for positron emission tomography (PET) have been developed that incorporate magnetic resonance (MR) imaging structural information, producing reconstructed images with improved suppression of noise and reduced partial volume effects. However, the influence of MR structural information also increases the possibility of suppression or bias of structures present only in the PET data (PET-unique regions). To address this, further developments for MR-informed methods have been proposed, for example, through inclusion of the current reconstructed PET image, alongside the MR image, in the iterative reconstruction process. In this present work, a number of kernel and maximum a posteriori (MAP) methodologies are compared, with the aim of identifying methods that enable a favorable trade-off between the suppression of noise and the retention of unique features present in the PET data. Methods: The reconstruction methods investigated were: the MR-informed conventional and spatially compact kernel methods, referred to as KEM and KEM largest value sparsification (LVS) respectively; the MR-informed Bowsher and Gaussian MR-guided MAP methods; and the PET-MR-informed hybrid kernel and anato-functional MAP methods. The trade-off between improving the reconstruction of the whole brain region and the PET-unique regions was investigated for all methods in comparison with postsmoothed maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM), evaluated in terms of structural similarity index (SSIM), normalized root mean square error (NRMSE), bias, and standard deviation. Both simulated BrainWeb (10 noise realizations) and real [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) three-dimensional datasets were used. The real [18F]FDG dataset was augmented with simulated tumors to allow comparison of the reconstruction methodologies for the case of known regions of PET-MR discrepancy and evaluated at full counts (100{\%}) and at a reduced (10{\%}) count level. Results: For the high-count simulated and real data studies, the anato-functional MAP method performed better than the other methods under investigation (MR-informed, PET-MR-informed and postsmoothed MLEM), in terms of achieving the best trade-off for the reconstruction of the whole brain and PET-unique regions, assessed in terms of the SSIM, NRMSE, and bias vs standard deviation. The inclusion of PET information in the anato-functional MAP method enables the reconstruction of PET-unique regions to attain similarly low levels of bias as unsmoothed MLEM, while moderately improving the whole brain image quality for low levels of regularization. However, for low count simulated datasets the anato-functional MAP method performs poorly, due to the inclusion of noisy PET information in the regularization term. For the low counts simulated dataset, KEM LVS and to a lesser extent, HKEM performed better than the other methods under investigation in terms of achieving the best trade-off for the reconstruction of the whole brain and PET-unique regions, assessed in terms of the SSIM, NRMSE, and bias vs standard deviation. Conclusion: For the reconstruction of noisy data, multiple MR-informed methods produce favorable whole brain vs PET-unique region trade-off in terms of the image quality metrics of SSIM and NRMSE, comfortably outperforming the whole image denoising of postsmoothed MLEM.},

abstract = {PET image reconstruction is highly susceptible to the impact of Poisson noise, and if shorter acquisition times or reduced injected doses are used, the noisy PET data become even more limiting. The recent development of kernel expectation maximisation (KEM) is a simple way to reduce noise in PET images, and we show in this work that impressive dose reduction can be achieved when the kernel method is used with MR-derived kernels. The kernel method is shown to surpass maximum likelihood expectation maximisation (MLEM) for the reconstruction of low-count datasets (corresponding to those obtained at reduced injected doses) producing visibly clearer reconstructions for unsmoothed and smoothed images, at all count levels. The kernel EM reconstruction of 10{\%} of the data had comparable whole brain voxel-level error measures to the MLEM reconstruction of 100{\%} of the data (for simulated data, at 100 iterations). For regional metrics, the kernel method at reduced dose levels attained a reduced coefficient of variation and more accurate mean values compared to MLEM. However, the advances provided by the kernel method are at the expense of possible over-smoothing of features unique to the PET data. Further assessment on clinical data is required to determine the level of dose reduction that can be routinely achieved using the kernel method, whilst maintaining the diagnostic utility of the scan.},

abstract = {In this study, we investigate the application of multi-parametric anato-functional (MR-PET) priors for the maximum a posteriori (MAP) reconstruction of brain PET data in order to address the limitations of the conventional anatomical priors in the presence of PET-MR mismatches. In addition to partial volume correction benefits, the suitability of these priors for reconstruction of low-count PET data is also introduced and demonstrated, comparing to standard maximum-likelihood (ML) reconstruction of high-count data. The conventional local Tikhonov and total variation (TV) priors and current state-of-the-art anatomical priors including the Kaipio, non-local Tikhonov prior with Bowsher and Gaussian similarity kernels are investigated and presented in a unified framework. The Gaussian kernels are calculated using both voxel- and patch-based feature vectors. To cope with PET and MR mismatches, the Bowsher and Gaussian priors are extended to multi-parametric priors. In addition, we propose a modified joint Burg entropy prior that by definition exploits all parametric information in the MAP reconstruction of PET data. The performance of the priors was extensively evaluated using 3D simulations and two clinical brain datasets of [ 18 F]florbetaben and [ 18 F]FDG radiotracers. For simulations, several anato-functional mismatches were intentionally introduced between the PET and MR images, and furthermore, for the FDG clinical dataset, two PET-unique active tumours were embedded in the PET data. Our simulation results showed that the joint Burg entropy prior far outperformed the conventional anatomical priors in terms of preserving PET unique lesions, while still reconstructing functional boundaries with corresponding MR boundaries. In addition, the multi-parametric extension of the Gaussian and Bowsher priors led to enhanced preservation of edge and PET unique features and also an improved bias-variance performance. In agreement with the simulation results, the clinical results also showed that the Gaussian prior with voxel-based feature vectors, the Bowsher and the joint Burg entropy priors were the best performing priors. However, for the FDG dataset with simulated tumours, the TV and proposed priors were capable of preserving the PET-unique tumours. Finally, an important outcome was the demonstration that the MAP reconstruction of a low-count FDG PET dataset using the proposed joint entropy prior can lead to comparable image quality to a conventional ML reconstruction with up to 5 times more counts. In conclusion, multi-parametric anato-functional priors provide a solution to address the pitfalls of the conventional priors and are therefore likely to increase the diagnostic confidence in MR-guided PET image reconstructions.},

abstract = {In total hip arthroplasty (THA), accurate positioning of components is important for the functionality and long life of the implant. Femoral component version has been underinvestigated when compared with the acetabular cup. Accurate prediction of the femoral version on the preoperative plan is particularly important because a well-fitting uncemented stem will, by definition, press-fit into a version that is dictated by the anatomy of the proximal femur. A better understanding of this has recently become an unmet need because of the increased use of uncemented stems and of preoperative image-based planning. We present the first, three-dimensional (3D) comparison between the planned and achieved orientation and position of the femoral components in THA. We propose a comparison method that uses the 3D models of a, computed tomography-generated (CT-generated), preoperative plan and a postoperative CT to obtain the discrepancy in the six possible degrees of freedom. We ran a prospective study (level 2 evidence) of 30 patients undergoing uncemented THA to quantify the discrepancy between planned and achieved femoral stem orientation and position. The discrepancy was low for femoral stem vertical position and leg length, and varus-valgus and anterior-posterior orientation. The discrepancy was higher for femoral version with a mean (±SD) of −1.5 ± 7.8 deg. Surgeons should be aware of the variability of the eventual position of uncemented stems in THA and acknowledge the risk of achieving a less-than-optimal femoral version, different from the preoperative 3D CT plan.},

abstract = {Purpose Intramuscular fat infiltration is a dynamic process, in response to exercise and muscle health, which can be quantified by estimating fat fraction (FF) from Dixon MRI. Healthy hip abductor muscles are a good indicator of a healthy hip and an active lifestyle as they have a fundamental role in walking. The automated measurement of the abductors' FF requires the challenging task of segmenting them. We aimed to design, develop and evaluate a multi-atlas based method for automated measurement of fat fraction in the main hip abductor muscles: gluteus maximus (GMAX), gluteus medius (GMED), gluteus minimus (GMIN) and tensor fasciae latae (TFL). Method We collected and manually segmented Dixon MR images of 10 healthy individuals and 7 patients who underwent MRI for hip problems. Twelve of them were selected to build an atlas library used to implement the automated multi-atlas segmentation method. We compared the FF in the hip abductor muscles for the automated and manual segmentations for both healthy and patients groups. Measures of average and spread were reported for FF for both methods. We used the root mean square error (RMSE) to quantify the method accuracy. A linear regression model was used to explain the relationship between FF for automated and manual segmentations. Results The automated median (IQR) FF was 20.0(16.0–26.4) {\%}, 14.3(10.9–16.5) {\%}, 15.5(13.9–18.6) {\%} and 16.2(13.5–25.6) {\%} for GMAX, GMED, GMIN and TFL respectively, with a FF RMSE of 1.6{\%}, 0.8{\%}, 2.1{\%}, 2.7{\%}. A strong linear correlation (R2 = 0.93, p {\textless} .001, m = 0.99) was found between the FF from automated and manual segmentations. The mean FF was higher in patients than in healthy subjects. Conclusion The automated measurement of FF of hip abductor muscles from Dixon MRI had good agreement with FF measurements from manually segmented images. The method was accurate for both healthy and patients groups.},

abstract = {Purpose: To comprehensively evaluate both the acceleration and image-quality impacts of axial compression and its degree of modeling in fully 3D PET image reconstruction. Method: Despite being used since the very dawn of 3D PET reconstruction, there are still no extensive studies on the impact of axial compression and its degree of modeling during reconstruction on the end-point reconstructed image quality. In this work, an evaluation of the impact of axial compression on the image quality is performed by extensively simulating data with span values from 1 to 121. In addition, two methods for modeling the axial compression in the reconstruction were evaluated. The first method models the axial compression in the system matrix, while the second method uses an unmatched projector/backprojector, where the axial compression is modeled only in the forward projector. The different system matrices were analyzed by computing their singular values and the point response functions for small subregions of the FOV. The two methods were evaluated with simulated and real data for the Biograph mMR scanner. Results: For the simulated data, the axial compression with span values lower than 7 did not show a decrease in the contrast of the reconstructed images. For span 11, the standard sinogram size of the mMR scanner, losses of contrast in the range of 5-10 percentage points were observed when measured for a hot lesion. For higher span values, the spatial resolution was degraded considerably. However, impressively, for all span values of 21 and lower, modeling the axial compression in the system matrix compensated for the spatial resolution degradation and obtained similar contrast values as the span 1 reconstructions. Such approaches have the same processing times as span 1 reconstructions, but they permit significant reduction in storage requirements for the fully 3D sinograms. For higher span values, the system has a large condition number and it is therefore difficult to recover accurately the higher frequencies. Modeling the axial compression also achieved a lower coefficient of variation but with an increase of intervoxel correlations. The unmatched projector/backprojector achieved similar contrast values to the matched version at considerably lower reconstruction times, but at the cost of noisier images. For a line source scan, the reconstructions with modeling of the axial compression achieved similar resolution to the span 1 reconstructions. Conclusions: Axial compression applied to PET sinograms was found to have a negligible impact for span values lower than 7. For span values up to 21, the spatial resolution degradation due to the axial compression can be almost completely compensated for by modeling this effect in the system matrix at the expense of considerably larger processing times and higher intervoxel correlations, while retaining the storage benefit of compressed data. For even higher span values, the resolution loss cannot be completely compensated possibly due to an effective null space in the system. The use of an unmatched projector/backprojector proved to be a practical solution to compensate for the spatial resolution degradation at a reasonable computational cost but can lead to noisier images.},

abstract = {Purpose: To introduce a method that allows the generation of ultra high-resolution (submillimeter) heterogeneous digital PET brain phantoms and to provide a new publicly available [(Formula presented.) ]FDG phantom as an example. Method: The radiotracer distribution of the phantom is estimated by minimizing the Kullback–Leibler distance between the parameterized unknown phantom distribution and a radiotracer-specific template used as a reference. The phantom is modelled using the histological and tissue classified volumes of the BigBrain atlas to provide both high resolution and heterogeneity. The Hammersmith brain atlas is also included to allow the estimation of different activity values in different anatomical regions of the brain. Using this method, a realistic [(Formula presented.) ]FDG phantom was produced, where a single real [(Formula presented.) ]FDG scan was used as the reference to match. An MRI T1-weighted image, obtained from the BigBrain atlas, and a pseudo-CT are included to complete the dataset. A full PET-MRI dataset was simulated and reconstructed with MR-guided methods for the new [(Formula presented.) ]FDG phantom. Results: An ultra high-resolution (400 $\mu$m voxel size) and heterogeneous phantom for [(Formula presented.) ]FDG was obtained. The radiotracer activity follows the patterns observed in the scan used as a reference. The simulated PET-MRI dataset provided a realistic simulation that was able to be reconstructed with MR-guided methods. By visual inspection, the reconstructed images showed similar patterns to the real data and the improvements in contrast and noise with respect to the standard MLEM reconstruction were more modest compared to simulations done with a simpler phantom, which was created from the same MRI image used to assist the reconstruction. Conclusions: A method to create high-resolution heterogeneous digital brain phantoms for different PET radiotracers has been presented and successfully employed to create a new publicly available [(Formula presented.) ]FDG phantom. The generated phantom is of high resolution, is heterogeneous, and simulates the uptake of the radiotracer in the different regions of the brain.},

@article{Bland2018,
abstract = {Positron emission tomography (PET) is a highly sensitive functional and molecular imaging modality which can measure picomolar concentrations of an injected radionuclide. However, the physical sensitivity of PET is limited, and reducing the injected dose leads to low count data and noisy reconstructed images. A highly effective way of reducing noise is to reparameterise the reconstruction in terms of MR-derived spatial basis functions. Spatial basis functions derived using the kernel method have demonstrated excellent noise reduction properties and maintain shared PET-MR detailed structures. However, as previously shown in the literature, the MR-guided kernel method may lead to excessive smoothing of structures that are only present in the PET data. This work makes two main contributions in order to address this problem: first, we exploit the potential of the MR-guided kernel method to form more spatially-compact basis functions which are able to preserve PET-unique structures, and secondly, we consider reconstruction at the native MR resolution. The former contribution notably improves the recovery of structures which are unique to the PET data. These adaptations of the kernel method were compared to the conventional implementation of the MR-guided kernel method and also to MLEM, in terms of ability to recover PET unique structures for both simulated and real data. The spatially-compact kernel method showed clear visual and quantitative improvements in the reconstruction of the PET unique structures, relative to the conventional kernel method for all sizes of PET unique structures investigated, whilst maintaining to a large extent the impressive noise mitigating and detail preserving properties of the conventional MR-guided kernel method. We therefore conclude that a spatially-compact parameterisation of the MR-guided kernel method, should be the preferred implementation strategy in order to obviate unnecessary losses in PET-unique details.},

@article{Mehranian2018,
abstract = {In this paper, we propose a generalized joint sparsity regularization prior and reconstruction framework for the synergistic reconstruction of positron emission tomography (PET) and under sampled sensitivity encoded magnetic resonance imaging data with the aim of improving image quality beyond that obtained through conventional independent reconstructions. The proposed prior improves upon the joint total variation (TV) using a non-convex potential function that assigns a relatively lower penalty for the PET and MR gradients, whose magnitudes are jointly large, thus permitting the preservation and formation of common boundaries irrespective of their relative orientation. The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) optimization framework was exploited for the joint PET-MR image reconstruction. In this framework, the joint maximum a posteriori objective function was effectively optimized by alternating between well-established regularized PET and MR image reconstructions. Moreover, the dependency of the joint prior on the PET and MR signal intensities was addressed by a novel alternating scaling of the distribution of the gradient vectors. The proposed prior was compared with the separate TV and joint TV regularization methods using extensive simulation and real clinical data. In addition, the proposed joint prior was compared with the recently proposed linear parallel level sets (PLSs) method using a benchmark simulation data set. Our simulation and clinical data results demonstrated the improved quality of the synergistically reconstructed PET-MR images compared with the unregularized and conventional separately regularized methods. It was also found that the proposed prior can outperform both the joint TV and linear PLS regularization methods in assisting edge preservation and recovery of details, which are otherwise impaired by noise and aliasing artifacts. In conclusion, the proposed joint sparsity regularization within the presented a ADMM reconstruction framework is a promising technique, nonetheless our clinical results showed that the clinical applicability of joint reconstruction might be limited in current PET-MR scanners, mainly due to the lower resolution of PET images.},

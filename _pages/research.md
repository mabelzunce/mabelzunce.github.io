These are some of the research projects I have been working in the last years.

## PET Image Reconstruction Algorithms for Brain Imaging
In this figure, [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG brain images are shown for two different reconstruction
methods: Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization (MLEM) algorithm, the standard PET image reconstruction method,
and MR-Assisted MAP-EM reconstruction. The animation shows: 1) the same slice converging to a solution
during the reconstruction process, 2) all the slices for the final reconstructed image, and 3)
rotating Maximum Intensity Projections (MIPs).
